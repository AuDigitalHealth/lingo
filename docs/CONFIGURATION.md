# Snomio configuration guide

## Purpose

This documentation covers the main configuration items, particularly those that may vary across
deployments and include instructions on how to determine the correct values. It is not necessarily
and exhaustive list of all configuration items, but rather a guide to the most important ones.

This is intended to aid organisations wishing to stand up their own instance of the software to
determine how to correctly configure it.
